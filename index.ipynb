    "* An interaction is a particular property of three or more variables, where two or more variables interact in a non-additive manner when affecting a third variable\n",
    "* Polynomial regression allows for better fitting data that isn't well predicted using a linear model\n",
    "* The risk of polynomial regressions is that it's easier to overfit data, so it's important to consider the Bias-Variance trade-off\n",
    "* Ridge and lasso regressions are two techniques for making complex models more expensive in the cost fnction, reducing the risk of overfitting\n",
    "* AIC and BIC are techniques for selecting between models\n"
