# Section Recap

## Introduction

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in section 24 and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:
* An interaction is a particular property of three or more variables, where two or more variables interact in a non-additive manner when affecting a third variable
* Polynomial regression allows for better fitting data that isn't well predicted using a linear model
* The risk of polynomial regressions is that it's easier to overfit data, so it's important to consider the Bias-Variance trade-off
* Ridge and lasso regressions are two techniques for making complex models more expensive in the cost fnction, reducing the risk of overfitting
* AIC and BIC are techniques for selecting between models
